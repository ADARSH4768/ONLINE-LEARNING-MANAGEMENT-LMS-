Overview

LMS Project is a backend application for a simple Learning Management System (LMS) developed in Java. It uses a MySQL database and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to enable basic functionalities, including adding, retrieving, and managing students and courses within the system. This project is intended as a foundational example for building a fully functional LMS and serves as a hands-on learning tool for Java database operations, object-oriented programming, and DAO (Data Access Object) patterns.

Key features of LMSProject:

Student Management: Add new students, retrieve existing student information, and maintain unique email IDs.

Course Management: Add courses with descriptions and instructors, retrieve courses, and manage course details.

Enrollment System: Maintain a many-to-many relationship between students and courses, allowing students to enroll in multiple courses and courses to have multiple students.

Database Connectivity: Utilizes MySQL with JDBC for smooth database interactions.

LMSProject is built with modularity and scalability in mind, making it an ideal starting point for expanding LMS functionalities, such as grading systems, progress tracking, and course scheduling.

This project is suitable for Java developers interested in learning database interactions, setting up a relational database, and implementing CRUD operations in a structured, real-world project.
